Never finish.

From illustration to host servicing, animation, front-end coding, and many more, the person who accesses this page will instantly see a lot of (authorial) digital illustrations, some gifs, no text, an interactive background, and if the user is curious, it is possible to reveal (by inspecting code and uncomment a section) a fun secret.


It is not a product, it is an art project.

Have fun! :)
